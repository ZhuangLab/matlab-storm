function SmoothY=fastsmooth(Y,w,type,ends)% fastbsmooth(Y,w,type,ends) smooths vector Y with smooth %  of width w. Version 2.0, May 2008.% The argument "type" determines the smooth type:%   If type=1, rectangular (sliding-average or boxcar) %   If type=2, triangular (2 passes of sliding-average)%   If type=3, pseudo-Gaussian (3 passes of sliding-average)% The argument "ends" controls how the "ends" of the signal % (the first w/2 points and the last w/2 points) are handled.%   If ends=0, the ends are zero.  (In this mode the elapsed %     time is independent of the smooth width). The fastest.%   If ends=1, the ends are smoothed with progressively %     smaller smooths the closer to the end. (In this mode the  %     elapsed time increases with increasing smooth widths).% fastsmooth(Y,w,type) smooths with ends=0.% fastsmooth(Y,w) smooths with type=1 and ends=0.% Example:% fastsmooth([1 1 1 10 10 10 1 1 1 1],3)= [0 1 4 7 10 7 4 1 1 0]% fastsmooth([1 1 1 10 10 10 1 1 1 1],3,1,1)= [1 1 4 7 10 7 4 1 1 1]%  T.
